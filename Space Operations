Space Operations are those operations imacting or directly utilizing space and ground based capabilities to enhance the potential of the US and multinational partners 

Components of Space Operations
  Space Situational Awareness SSA is the requiste foundational current and predictive knowledge and characterization of space objects and the OE upon which space objects and the OE upon which space ops depend including physical virtual 
  information and human deminsions 
  Space Control -
    Offensive Space Control (OSC) - mislead through manipulatin, temporarily impair enemy, temporarily eliminate operation if system, permanently impair adversary use of system, permanently elimenate use of system
    Defensive Space Control (DSC)
    Navigation Warfare NAVWAR
  PNT
  ISR - space based intel collection synchronizes and integrates sensors assets and systems for gathering data and info on an object or in an area of interest on a persistent event driven or scheduled basis
  SATCOM

Dimensions of Space Domain
  Physical
  Network
  Cognitive
ability to conduct ops that access exploit and defend space rests on simultaneous action across all domains but requires consideration of the space domain's unique physical network and cognitive dimensions

Threats in Space
Nation State Threat - potentially most dangerous due to resource access personnel and time
Non State Threat - formal and informal orgs not bound by national borders; may be used by nation states or transnational actors to conduct attacks
Individual or Small Group Threat - can illegaly disrupt or gain access to systems or facilities; may be used by nation states or transnational actors
Man Made and Natural Hazards - disruption from human error industrial incidents and natural disasters; intentional or unintentional
