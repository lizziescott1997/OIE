US Joint Force Structure

Pre and Post WW2
US entered WW2 incapable of coordinating land sea and air activities across 2 military departments (War and Navy)
1942 FDR created Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)

National Security Act of 1947
effort to rectify US militarys disjointedness
created National Military Establishment (DOD precusor)
prescribed weak SECDEF
gave legal standing to JCS but no chairman
continued to empower Military Department Secretaries; service denomination continued to trump authority of unified commanders in the field
legislated revisions to Act attempted to mend deficiencies
Services retain "de facto" operational control

How Did We Get Here?
numerous military failures highlighted institutional defeciencies at all levels; ad hoc nature of joint effort in ops contributed to inability to effectively link tactical actions to strategic ends

Goldwater Nichols Act of 1986
several disparate factors came togethere in the mid 1980s which enabled DOD organizational change
appointment of reform minded CJCS Admiral William Crowe October 1985
Major Changes:
  Chain of Command and Miltiary Advice
  Interaction of the Services
  Personnel Management
  Shared Procurement
  CJCS removed from OPCON
  service component commands train, man, equip, and present forces

Command and Control

when commander/unit tasked to a mission, if they don't have capabilites they ask for it and become supported commander
supporting commander responsible for filling in gaps (bodies)
combatant commands can't delegate authority but can delegate operational and tactical control

Forces
Global Force Management GFM is process which allows SecDef to strategically manage employment of force among CCDRS; accomplished via 3 related processes: assignment, allocation, and apportionment
SECDEF assigns forces to CCDRs to meet Unified Command Plan missions and responsibilities
SECDEF allocates forces to CCDRs to meet current operational requirements
SECDEF apportions forces to CCDRs for planning

US Combatant Commands

Unified Commands
Joint forces established by either geographic area or on functional basis
only GCCs assigned areas of responsibility (AORs)
geographic combatant commanders forces can operate wherever required to accomplish missions
functional combatant commands operate accross all geographic regions and typical provide support to other CCDRs

USCENTCOM - Middle East; located in Tampa FL
USEUCOM - Europe and Russia; Stuttgart, Germany

USSPACECOM's AOR is space starting at 100 km above sea level
