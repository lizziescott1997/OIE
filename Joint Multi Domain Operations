3 quizzes and a final based on unclass material

5 operational domains:

  Space

    satellites - relay info through cyberspace
    area above altitude where atmospheric effects on airborne objects become negligible
    ****greater than 100 kilometers above mean sea level******

  Cyberspace

    communicate w/ links (radio waves, antennas, cell towers/cell signal (3G, 4G, etc)
    Internet (routers and switches, cables)
    **global domain w/in information environment consisting of interdependent network of info tech infrastructures and resident data including internet, telecomms, computer systems, and embededed processors and controllers
    dependent on physical domains
    critical portion of bandwith can only be provided via space ops which provides key global connectivity option for CO; interrelationships important considerations during planning***
    ****Layers: Physical network layer (hardware and infrastructure), logical network layer(abstracted from physical network; things w/ intrinsic value), cyber-persona layer(actor or entity in cyberspace)****
  
  Air

    planes (radar, radiowaves)
    air traffic control, instrumentation (info relayed to ATC)
    atmosphere beginning at earth's surface extending to altitude where effects upon ops become negligible
  
  Land

    personnel - radios, cell phones, computers
    area of earths surface ending at high water mark and overlapping w/ maritime domain in landward segment of littorals
  
  Maritime

    boats, submarines
    oceans, seas, bays, estuaries, islands, coastal areas and airspace above these including littorals

    **Joint All Domain Operations**
      describe how US DOD can counter and defeat near peer adversary capable of contesting US in all domains including Information Environment during competition and armed conflict
      provides commander numerous options for simultaneous and sequential ops
      uses surprise and rapid and continuous integration of capablities across all domains
      present multiple delimenas to adversary
      gain physical and psychological advantages
      gain influence and control over operational environment
      IE Ops must be integrated through planning and execution - baked in vs sprinkled on
      integrated planning and employment of joint and Interagency info capablities resources and activities that enhance single battle concept and provide defensive offensive exploitative effects and support in order to operate
      fight and win through contested info environment

  The Problem

  **competition and conflict**
    w/ China and Russia

MDEB = Multi Domain Effects Batallion
conducts continuous multi domain joint target development and intel ops and on order provides SIGINT, Information Operations (IO), limited cyber ops, Electronic Warfare (EW), and space ops
***MDEB supports MDTF targetting efforts by providing near real-time SIGINT, GEOINT and OSINT target acquistion and products***
MEF Information Group (MIG) coordinates integrates and employs capabilities for info environment ops in order to ensure MAGTF Commanders ability to facilitate friendly forces manuever and deny enemy freedom of action
in informatin environment

Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations
form of expeditonary warefar that involves employment of mobile low signature persistent and relatively easy to maintain and sustain naval expeditionary forces
Characteristics
  Stand In Forces
  Mobility
  Persistence - move w/ high degree of flexiblity w/in areas of key maritime terrain
  Low Signature - forces conducting EABO carefully manage physical and EMS signatures at all times
  Integrated Naval Forces
  Cost Effective
