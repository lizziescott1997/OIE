Infrastructure Management - coordinate w/ JMOC for resource allocation

Access and Capabilities
Synergy of effort: Platform + access + capabilities = effects supporting warfighter

Initial acces is the basis for all network exploitation; having established intial access the operator may emplace a capability that provides more robust accesses to the targeted
system or that escalates the privilege of access to a higher level
Access Methods
Intrusion or Access Vectors

Logical Access
  Reconnaissance - active and passive
  Active - positive interaction made
  Passive - no direct interaction made

Physical access
  Human contact
  Social engineering - can be physical and logical
  Direct physical access (close access)

Concealement
Entrenchment - ensuring continued access to target and hiding any trace of the access; primary goal is to gain unsuspected, sustained, and unrestricted access to information system

Cyberspace Capabilities
Cyberspace attack capability (computer network attack cna)
non-cyber-attack capability (computer network exploitation cne)

Cyberspace attack
D4M
Deny, Degrade, Disrupt, Destroy, Manipulate to create physical effects

Vulnerability - weakness in info system, system security procedures, intern control, or implementation that could be exploited by threat source
Exploitation - enables operations and intel collection capabilities conducted through use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated info systems or networks
Threat source - intent and method targeted at intentional exploitation of vulnerability or situation and method that may accidentally exploit vulnerability; term traditionally called
exploit in network security industry to label method or toll used
