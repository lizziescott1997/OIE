Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) is maneuver space essential for facillitating control w/in operational environment (OE) and impacts all portions of OE and military ops

Guding Principles Strategy builds upon existing Joint and Service doctrine and operational concepts that incorporate full range of military activities in the EMS

Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) is military actions undertaken by joint force to exploit, attack, protect, and manage electromagnetic environment rely on personnel and systems
from EW, EMS management, intelligence, space, and cyberspace mission areas
JEMSO Related Mission Areas
  Cyberspace Operations (CO)
  Space Operations
  Air Land and Maritime Operations

Electromagnetic Operational Environment (EMOE) is a maneuver space, a battlespace, a place where competition and warfare, as well as commerce and other nonmilitary activities are conducted
in modern warfare, EMS superiority is a leading indicator and fundamental component of achieving superiority in air, land, sea, space, or cyberspace
EMS as the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation, is a fundamental component of the natural environment, and the EMOE is a space in which military functions are performed

EMOE Complexity
  Contested - enemy activities detect disrupt exploit degrade deny decieve or destroy friendly EMS capablities for purpose of military advantage
  Congested - military and civilian dependent systems continue to crowd the spectrum and increase amount of unintentional interference
  Constrained - domestic and international regulations cause amount of spectrum available for military access to decrease

Electromagnetic Warfare has 3 major subdivisions: Electromagnetic Attack EA Electromagnetic Protection EP and Electromagnetic Support ES
Military Operations are executed in an information environment increasingly complicated by the electromagnetic spectrum; EMS portion of the information environment is referred to as the 
electromagnetic environment EME; recognized need for military forces to have unimpeded access to and use of the EME creates vulnerabilities and opportunities for EW in support of military ops
